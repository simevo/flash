# flash

An open-source news platform with aggregation and ranking.

Second iteration born from the ashes of [**calo.news** ("An open-source news platform with aggregation, ranking and conversations")](https://gitlab.com/simevo/calo.news), sharing the same Postgres DB structure but:

- without PHP
- based on a modern Python web framework (Django and Django REST Framework) for the back-end
- using TypeScript and an up-to-date vite-based tooling for the Vue.js frontend
- and ready for deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

## TL;DR

Start flash:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up flash

then open the UI at: http://localhost:8100/.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec django /entrypoint python3 manage.py createsuperuser --email root@example.com --username root

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy flash

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally.html#using-webpack-or-gulp).

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
cd flash
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important _where_ the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with _manage.py_, you should be right.

To run [periodic tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html), you'll need to start the celery beat scheduler service. You can start it as a standalone process:

```bash
cd flash
celery -A config.celery_app beat
```

or you can embed the beat service inside a worker with the `-B` option (not recommended for production use):

```bash
cd flash
celery -A config.celery_app worker -B -l info
```

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.

### Docker

See detailed [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-deployment/deployment-with-docker.html).

## Updating JavaScript dependencies

JS and CSS dependencies are managed with `yarnpkg` and the files are put in place with `make` then checked into the repo.

In this way the files are vendored and the repo is self-sufficient, but it's easy to upgrade them and add new dependencies.

To **upgrade** the dependencies:

    yarnpkg upgrade

then reinstall them:

    make

To **add a new dependency**, install it with `yarnpkg add ...` or `yarnpkg add -D ...`, update the `Makefile` to put in place the files you need and `git add ...` them.

Dont't forget to commit your changes!
